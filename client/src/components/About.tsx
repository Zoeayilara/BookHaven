                Francis Egbogun is a Christian leader, pastor, and philanthropist who has been 
                a faithful minister of God for over three decades. First visited by God in a 
                vision in 1991, he received a global mandate that would reach many nations. 
                In 1993, the LORD commissioned him through the Holy Spirit to set His people 
                free from bondageâ€”a mandate he has faithfully pursued ever since.
